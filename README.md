OntoSuSD is devloped by reusing widely agreed ontologies SMO, PrMO and OntoAgile in POEM engineering development methodology. OntoSuSD is evaluated using state-of-the-art ontology evaluation tools and metrics. The results have shown OntoSuSD has high ontological design, good coverage of the domain and fulfills objectives of the ontology development.
